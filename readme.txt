The AR view allows to project a given model to the view and supports gesture recognizer to drag the model to move to different location in the space. The collage feature allows users to choose between two templates: vertical and horizontal. Images selected using the photo picker are collaged based on the selected template, and users can save the collaged image to their photo library with a success alert. We have also incorporated navigation to a separate view for collage creation.
